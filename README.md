📚 Library Management System – SQL
-- Project Overview
This project is a Library Management System designed using SQL to efficiently manage books, publishers, authors, members, and borrowing records. 
The system demonstrates strong understanding of relational database design, constraints, and SQL queries for real-world data management scenarios.
The database ensures data integrity, normalization, and consistency by implementing Primary Keys, Foreign Keys, and relationships between multiple entities.

-- Objectives
Design a normalized relational database for a library system
Maintain accurate records of books, publishers, and members
Enforce data integrity using constraints
Perform efficient data retrieval using SQL queries

-- Tech Used
Database: MySQL
Language: SQL
-- Tools: MySQL Workbench

-- Database Schema
The project includes multiple interrelated tables such as: 
Book – Stores book details and publisher information
Publisher – Maintains publisher records
Author – Tracks author details
Member – Manages library members
Issue / Borrow – Records book transactions
Relationships are implemented using foreign key constraints, ensuring referential integrity across tables.

-- Key Features
Relational database design with normalization
Use of PRIMARY KEY and FOREIGN KEY constraints
Structured table creation and data insertion
SQL queries for data retrieval and validation
Error handling through constraint enforcement

-- How to Run the Project
Open MySQL Workbench
Create a new database or use the provided one
Execute the SQL_Project_Code_file.sql
Run SELECT queries to view and analyze data

-- Learning Outcomes
Strong understanding of SQL database design
Hands-on experience with relational constraints
Improved query writing and debugging skills
Real-world application of database concepts

-- Future Enhancements
Add stored procedures and triggers
Implement indexing for performance optimization
Integrate with a front-end application
Add role-based access control
